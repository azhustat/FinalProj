As Siqi mentioned in his email, 
"
We can now do a topic search in python weibo api. But before that you will need to fix a bug manually. In utils.py under the folder weibopy, replace the parse_search_datetime method by the following code:

def parse_search_datetime(str):
    return datetime(*(time.strptime(str, '%a %b %d %H:%M:%S +0800 %Y')[0:6]))
"

sampling.py: takes a sample of searching result using 林书豪, Jeremy Lin's name in simplified Chinese and saves the sample into a file "jlsample.txt" in UTF8 encoding. Recall that the second line of adding sys.path is machine specific. 

pipeline.sh: contains the basic workflow of processing. Don't run it directly since SegMain.java is not in current directory.
The basic ideas are as follows:
1. pre-segmentation processing: [python preseg.py jlsample.txt]
	a) keep only the first reposting. repostings can be identified by "//"
	b) need to remove URL as well since ICTCLAS doesn't handle it well (need to do this before remove mentioning)
	c) change mentions to @
(Note: don't worry about topic "#...#" since we are going to remove punctuation marks later)

2. ICTCLAS
with user dictionary "userdict.txt"

3. post-segmentation processing: [python postseg.py seg_result.txt]
remove punctuation marks

There are more to be done in term of processing. Please take a look at the TXT files:
jlsample.txt has the samples
preseg.txt is the result of pre-segmentation processing
seg_result.txt is the result of ICTCLAS
postseg.txt is the result of post-segmentation processing

See you on Friday! -- AZ
